HTML Structure: I've used HTML to create the structure of my application. This likely includes elements like text input fields for task entry, buttons for adding, deleting, and saving tasks, and a container to display the tasks.

CSS Styling: CSS is used to style my application, making it visually appealing and user-friendly. Ans I also  used Bootstrap, a popular CSS framework, to help with styling and responsiveness.

JavaScript Logic: Here's how I've likely used it:-

Adding Tasks: I have JavaScript code that handles adding tasks when I click an "Add" button. This code may create new HTML elements (list items) to represent the tasks and append them to the task list.

Deleting Tasks: When I click a "Delete" button next to a task, my JavaScript code likely removes that specific task from the list.

Saving Tasks: Saving tasks might involve storing them in some way, like in the browser's local storage, so that the tasks persist even if I refresh the page.

User Interaction: JavaScript handles user interactions, like clicking buttons and inputting text. Event listeners are often used to respond to these interactions.
